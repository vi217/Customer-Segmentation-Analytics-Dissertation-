- Overcoming Failure in GenAI Startups
A Cluster Analysis Using the STP Framework

Portfolio project by Varis Ithivatana – MSc Business Analytics, University of Exeter

- Project Summary

This project explores why many Generative AI startups fail — and how data-driven marketing can help them find the right target users.
Using a UK public survey of 3,513 respondents, I used cluster analysis and the STP (Segmentation–Targeting–Positioning) framework to identify four types of GenAI users and develop marketing strategies to improve product–market fit.

- Key Findings

4 user groups were identified: Enthusiasts, Optimists, Sceptics, and Observers.

Professionals who value productivity and trust are the best early adopters.

GenAI startups should focus on transparency, usefulness, and safety in their products.
